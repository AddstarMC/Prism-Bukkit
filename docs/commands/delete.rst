Delete
======

.. tip::

  | /prism delete <params>

Server operators can use ``/prism delete [timeframe]`` to manually purge records from the database. This isn't usually necessary, as Prism will automatically purge records (per config) every 12 hours. See :ref:`purging`. All parameters will work with delete.
