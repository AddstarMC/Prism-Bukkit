**GPrism** is a Bukkit plugin that tracks changes to a Minecraft world. These changes can be looked
up, rolled back, restored, etc. There are also various anti-griefing tools.

GPrism is a downstream fork of @viveleroi's [Prism-Bukkit][PRISM], with various fixes and feature
additions by a few GitHub contributors and Roy Curtis.

For information on how to use GPrism, [see the original Prism wiki.][WIKI]

# Support

Prism-Bukkit was abandoned in favor of the [Sponge rewrite][SPONGE]. This fork is not intended to be
a long-term continuation of Prism; this is only for our fixes, to keep Prism-Bukkit working. We may
remove features that we don't use or think should be provided by GPrism.

That said; please feel free to cherry pick commits or fork from this fork, or contribute to this
fork with issues and pull requests.

**Only the latest server version (1.11.2) is supported; older servers may break GPrism.**
