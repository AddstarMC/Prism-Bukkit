### An historical Note from Viveleroi

Having a run a busy public server for eighteen months, I had a long wanted to write a rollback plugin that truly solved our needs. We've been through multiple rollback plugins but were never satisfied, and unfortunately fairly displeased with some. 

A day before New Years I began an experiment for such a plugin - testing the waters. Initial work went very well and I saw a clear path ahead. Over the next several weeks work progressed at a rapid pace, and soon several staff members from our servers were jumping at the chance to test and see its progression.

Our road to 1.0 was extremely successful and by 1.1 we're already running on 300+ servers a day. I have yet to hear anyone who's tried it do anything other than praise it or say it won't work for their needs. 

Prism shows so much potential, it makes sense to open source it. Despite releasing a lot of work as open source in the past, I've been hesitant to open Prism for a number of likely warrant-less personal concerns. However, I recognize that Prism needs the benefit of contributions from our rapidly growing community.
